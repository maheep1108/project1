        <h3>2nd year software engineering</h3>
        <p style="font-family: Arial">I started creating simple java projects when I was 12 years old and have loved the idea of software engineering since then. I have always had a passion for how things work, especially websites and games.</p>

<h1> Work Experience </h1>
<ul>
  <li><u>Taxtron</u></li>
  <p1>Over the summer I worked a co-op at TaxTron as a web developer. My job was to create an in-house e-signature code that would allow users to sign pdfs and documents without the need of a third party application. This helped Taxtron save money as there was no need to purchase any third party softwares swell.

<li> <u> NDP</u> </li>
<p1> At NDP my job was to canvass the neighbourhood and hand out flyers and provide information to all residents about the election in 2019. I was in charge of my own group and I had to make sure everyone stayed on task and completed their assignments on time. </p1>
